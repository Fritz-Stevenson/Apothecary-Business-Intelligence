# Business-Data-Analysis
***Sales data analysis and the creation of a customer profile database.***

**Analysis Overview**

This data analysis project is built for a small business with a large range of products and fairly high variability in sales trends. Products and even product lines can vary greatly in terms of sales change month over month. In order to maintain stock of inventory and ingredients, and pinpoint potential quality assurance problems, it is important to understand generalized trends and outliers. This Analysis Project tackles this problem as well as addressing inventory purchasing, promotional email lists based on time since last order, and the creation of a customer profile database to pinpoint sales trends on a customer basis.


**Analysis instructions:**

This repository is for demonstrative purpose only. There is a jupyter walkthrough folder that can be downloaded for review of the work and functions of the package. All files will need to be uploaded or linked to a Jupyter directory as the scripts are called in the jupyter walkthrough notebook.
